# LCPN
<h1>Ladder Colored Petri Net</h1>
<h2>We propose a method for modelling of ladder diagrams named LCPN (Ladder Colored Petri Net).</h2>
<p>In LCPN, not only the logic of ladder diagrams could be simulated but also the scanning paradigm which includes reading inputs, evaluating rungs, updating outputs could be modeled. </p>
<p> tools we used: antlr, java, jdom2 </p>
