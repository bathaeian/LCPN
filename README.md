# LCPN
Ladder Colored Petri Net
We propose a method for modelling of ladder diagrams named LCPN (Ladder Colored Petri Net).
In LCPN, not only the logic of ladder diagrams could be simulated but also the scanning paradigm which includes reading inputs, evaluating rungs, updating outputs could be modeled.
